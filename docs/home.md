# Mallow - Another PHP framework

> A mix between old-school and standardized framework.

Very inspired from [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) because I love this framework.

## Featuring

- MVC pattern
- Localization (by section / with multiple files)
- Router with localized routes and regex (be careful to sort them correctly !)
- Database abstraction layer with PDO
- Mini ORM (models are object :))
- Authentication
- Flash messages
- Registry to share data (PSR-11 like)
- Dotenv file for sensitive configuration (to not commit !)
- CSRF protection
- [Debugbar](https://github.com/maximebf/php-debugbar)

But :
- No request and response handling (PSR-15)
- No view templates (PHP is a template language btw)
